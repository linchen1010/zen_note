# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by combining them with external knowledge retrieval systems. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG allows the system to access and incorporate relevant information from external sources in real-time.

## How RAG Works

1. **Query Processing**: The user's question is processed and converted into a vector representation
2. **Document Retrieval**: The system searches through a vector database to find relevant documents
3. **Context Injection**: Retrieved documents are injected into the prompt as context
4. **Generation**: The LLM generates an answer based on both its training and the retrieved context

## Benefits of RAG

- **Up-to-date Information**: Access to current information beyond training data
- **Factual Accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved facts
- **Transparency**: Users can see which sources were used to generate the answer
- **Cost Effective**: No need to retrain models for new information

## Common Use Cases

- **Knowledge Management**: Internal company documentation systems
- **Customer Support**: Automated responses based on help documentation
- **Research Assistance**: Academic and scientific research support
- **Personal Knowledge**: Personal note-taking and knowledge retrieval systems
