# Vector Databases

## Introduction

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, index, and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential components in modern AI applications, particularly for similarity search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation.

## Key Features

### High-Dimensional Data Storage
Vector databases can handle vectors with hundreds or thousands of dimensions, representing complex data like text embeddings, image features, or audio characteristics.

### Similarity Search
The primary function is to find vectors that are "similar" to a query vector using various distance metrics:
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the angle between vectors
- **Euclidean Distance**: Traditional geometric distance
- **Dot Product**: Inner product similarity
- **Manhattan Distance**: L1 norm distance

### Indexing Algorithms

#### HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
- Graph-based indexing
- Excellent query performance
- Good recall rates
- Used by many modern vector databases

#### IVF (Inverted File Index)
- Clustering-based approach
- Good for large datasets
- Trade-off between speed and accuracy

#### LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)
- Hash-based approximation
- Very fast queries
- May sacrifice some accuracy

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Text Chunking**: Split documents into appropriate sizes
2. **Embedding Generation**: Convert text to vectors using models like:
   - Sentence Transformers
   - OpenAI embeddings
   - Google Universal Sentence Encoder

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple vectors at once
- **Index Configuration**: Tune index parameters for your use case
- **Memory Management**: Consider RAM requirements for large datasets

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Distribute across multiple nodes
- **Sharding**: Split large datasets across multiple indexes
- **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching strategies

## Best Practices

### Choosing Embedding Models
- Consider domain-specific models for specialized content
- Balance model size with performance requirements
- Test different models with your specific data

### Index Configuration
- Start with default parameters and iterate
- Monitor query latency and recall metrics
- Consider rebuilding indexes periodically

### Data Management
- Implement version control for embeddings
- Plan for incremental updates
- Consider backup and recovery strategies
